    This is the shared "closest relative" primitive for both closest-target aggregates:
    ``lca`` + ``max`` uses it directly, and on an ultrametric tree ``path`` + ``min`` is
    the affine transform ``2D - 2 * score`` of it (see :func:`_compute_scores`).

    For a source leaf ``i``, the deepest (most recent) common ancestor it shares with
    *any* leaf ``j`` of category ``c`` is the deepest ancestor of ``i`` whose subtree
    still contains a ``c`` leaf.  Its depth is therefore :math:`\\max_j d_{LCA(i, j)}`.
    Unlike the path-distance Dijkstra shortcut, this holds regardless of whether the
    tree is ultrametric, so it is exact on non-ultrametric trees too.

    The subtree category membership is built with a single bottom-up pass (reversed
    topological order visits every child before its parent); each source leaf then
    walks up its ancestor chain, recording the first — hence deepest — ancestor that
    covers each still-unresolved category.  A leaf is its own subtree, so a source leaf
    belonging to ``c`` scores its own depth (the maximal possible LCA depth).

    r"""Quantify relatedness of cells in different categories.

    For each cell, the tree distance to the nearest cell of each target category is
    computed.  These per-cell distances are then averaged across all cells of the same
    source category to produce a directional linkage score: a low path distance (or high
    LCA depth) between two categories means they tend to share recent common ancestors,
    i.e. they are closely related on the tree.

    **Pairwise mode** (``target=None``): computes a category × category matrix of mean
    linkage scores and stores it in ``tdata.uns['{key_added}_linkage']``.

    **Single-target mode** (``target=<category>``): computes the per-cell distance to
    the nearest cell of the given category and stores it in
    ``tdata.obs['{target}_linkage']``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tdata
        The TreeData object.
    groupby
        Column in ``tdata.obs`` that defines cell categories.
    target
        If specified, compute the per-cell distance to the nearest cell of this
        category and store the result in ``tdata.obs['{target}_linkage']``.
        ``aggregate`` is ignored in this mode.
        If ``None`` (default), compute the full pairwise category × category matrix.
    aggregate
        How per-cell distances to the target category are aggregated into a single
        per-cell score (pairwise mode only).  Defaults to ``'min'`` for
        ``metric='path'`` and ``'max'`` for ``metric='lca'``, both of which
        select the nearest relative:

        - ``'min'``: distance to the closest target cell (natural for ``'path'``).
        - ``'max'``: depth of the deepest (most recent) LCA across target cells (natural for ``'lca'``).
        - ``'mean'``: mean distance across all target cells.
        - A callable ``f(array) -> float`` for custom aggregation.
    metric
        How tree distance between two cells is measured:

        - ``'lca'`` (default): depth of the lowest common ancestor
          :math:`d_{\mathrm{LCA}(i,j)}`.  Larger values mean closer relatives.
        - ``'path'``: branch-length path distance
          :math:`d_i + d_j - 2\,d_{\mathrm{LCA}(i,j)}`.  Smaller values mean closer
          relatives.
    symmetrize
        How to symmetrize the pairwise linkage matrix (pairwise mode only). Because linkage
        is directional (source → target), the raw matrix is generally asymmetric;
        symmetrization combines both directions:

        - ``'mean'`` (default): average of :math:`M[i,j]` and :math:`M[j,i]`.
        - ``'max'`` / ``'min'``: element-wise maximum / minimum.
        - ``False``: leave the matrix asymmetric.
    normalize
        If ``True`` (default), subtract the permuted mean from the observed values: pairwise
        linkage matrix becomes ``observed - permuted_mean``; single-target
        ``tdata.obs['{target}_linkage']`` becomes ``cell_score - category_permuted_mean``.
        This works regardless of ``test``: a single permutation is run to estimate the
        permuted mean when ``test=None`` (see ``n_permutations``).
    min_size
        Minimum number of cells a category must have to be included (pairwise mode only).
        Categories with fewer than ``min_size`` cells are dropped before the linkage matrix
        is computed, so they appear as neither source rows nor target columns and their
        cells do not contribute to any score.  Defaults to ``1`` (no filtering).  A warning
        lists any retained categories with fewer than 10 cells, whose linkage will be noisy.
    test
        Optional significance test:

        - ``'permutation'``: randomly shuffle cell-category labels ``n_permutations``
          times and recompute linkage each time to build a null distribution.
          Z-scores and p-values are added to the stats table.
    non
        The alternative hypothesis for the permutation test (ignored when
        ``test=None``):

        - ``'one-sided'`` (default): one-tailed test in the "more closely related than
          chance" direction — p-value is the fraction of permutations with LCA depth
          ≥ observed (``metric='lca'``) or path distance ≤ observed
          (``metric='path'``).
        - ``'two-sided'``: two-tailed test — p-value is the fraction of permutations
          whose deviation from the null mean is at least as large as the observed
          deviation.
    permutation_mode
        How category labels are shuffled to build the permutation null (used both for the
        significance test and for the ``normalize`` permuted mean):

        - ``'non_target'`` (default): fix the target category's leaves at their tree
          positions and shuffle only the non-target labels.  The null therefore reflects
          "random cells near this specific target cluster," which removes inflation
          caused by small, tightly clustered target categories.  In pairwise mode
          each target column gets its own independent null distribution.
        - ``'all'``: shuffle all cell-category labels across all leaves.
          Tests whether the two categories are more associated on the tree than
          random, but does not control for the target category's cluster structure.

    n_permutations
        Number of label permutations used when ``test='permutation'``.  When ``test=None``
        a single permutation is used to estimate the permuted mean for ``normalize``.
    n_threads
        Number of worker processes for parallel permutation computation.
        ``None`` (default) runs serially.  On Linux, parallel execution uses
        ``fork``-based processes, which copy the parent's memory without
        serialisation overhead.  On other platforms this argument is ignored.
    depth_key
        Node attribute in ``tdata.obst[tree]`` that stores each node's depth.
    random_state
        Random seed for reproducibility of permutation tests.
    key_added
        Base key for output storage.  Defaults to ``groupby``.
    tree
        The ``obst`` key or keys of the trees to use.  If ``None``, all trees are used.
    copy
        If ``True``, return the result as a :class:`DataFrame <pandas.DataFrame>`.

    Returns
    -------
    Returns ``None`` if ``copy=False``, otherwise returns a :class:`DataFrame <pandas.DataFrame>`.

    Sets the following fields:

    * ``tdata.obs['{target}_linkage']`` : :class:`Series <pandas.Series>` (dtype ``float``) – single-target mode only.
        Per-cell distance to the nearest cell of the target category.  When
        ``normalize=True``, replaced by ``cell_score - category_permuted_mean``.
    * ``tdata.uns['{key_added}_linkage']`` : :class:`DataFrame <pandas.DataFrame>` – pairwise mode only.
        Category × category linkage matrix (source rows, target columns).
        When ``normalize=True``, contains ``observed - permuted_mean`` instead of raw distances.
    * ``tdata.uns['{key_added}_linkage_params']`` : ``dict`` – pairwise mode only.
        Parameters used to compute the linkage matrix.
    * ``tdata.uns['{key_added}_linkage_stats']`` : :class:`DataFrame <pandas.DataFrame>` – pairwise mode only.
        Long-form table with one row per (source, target) pair containing ``value``,
        ``source_n``, ``target_n``, and ``permuted_value`` (always, from at least one
        permutation), plus ``z_score`` and ``p_value`` when ``test='permutation'``.
